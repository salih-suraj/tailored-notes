## STOP — Infrastructure Gaps (do before continuing any features)

These are non-negotiable requirements from the build brief that have been skipped.
Every new feature added without them makes the retrofit harder.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| I1 | Build `core/audit/` — AuditLogWriter called by every repository on every mutation | ✅ | AuditLogTable + AuditLogDao + AuditLogWriter. Wired into DailyNotesRepository + ChecklistItemsRepository. schemaVersion bumped to 3. |
| I2 | Add `created_by` + `updated_by` to DailyNotesTable and ChecklistItemsTable | ✅ | `updated_by_id/name` on DailyNotesTable. `created_by_id/updated_by_id` on ChecklistItemsTable. Every new table must include these from day one. |
| I3 | Fix AppStrings violations in all existing screens | ✅ | All 4 screens fixed. Added: childNotFound, careRecordSection, module labels/descs, checklist strings, observation strings. |
| I4 | MFA for Manager and Inspector roles | ✅ | `MfaScreen` built — enrollment mode (first-time TOTP setup with manual secret key entry) + challenge mode (ongoing 6-digit code). Triggers automatically post-login via `needsMfaChallenge` on `AppUser`. Session upgrades to AAL2 on success. Supabase TOTP enabled platform-wide. |
| I5 | Semantic labels on all interactive elements | 🔧 | Code complete 2026-06-12. Nav shell was done; added: `Semantics(button:)` on module cards (×11 via `_ModuleCard`), child list tiles, daily note cards, inspector grant cards, parent child cards; `Semantics(checked:)` toggle announcement on checklist task tiles; 200% text-scale support via `MediaQuery.textScaler.clamp(max: 2.0)` in the app builder. All extended FABs carry text labels (accessible natively); IconButtons audited — all have tooltips. Remaining record-card InkWells rely on InkWell's built-in tap semantics + merged text children (labelled, not explicitly role-announced). **Needs a TalkBack/VoiceOver + 200% font device pass to call done.** |

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Project setup, folder structure, pubspec.yaml | ✅ | |
| 2 | Design tokens — colours, spacing, radius, typography | ✅ | |
| 3 | Theme — light + dark ThemeData | ✅ | |
| 4 | Router skeleton — all top-level routes, placeholder screens | ✅ | `/daily-notes` tab (Support Worker + Team Leader) now shows `DailyNotesHubScreen` — lists all children, tap routes to that child's daily notes. Other unused top-level placeholders remain as stubs. |
| 5 | Supabase client — EU region, --dart-define credentials, safe null init | ✅ | |
| 6 | Auth — login screen, role-based redirect, MFA | ✅ | Email/password login + MFA (TOTP) for Manager and Inspector. Settings screen with sign-out, theme switcher, user/role card. |
| 7 | Navigation shell — bottom bar (mobile) + rail (tablet) + extended rail (wide) | ✅ | Role-based tabs. Semantic labels on icons. |
| 8 | Children list screen | ✅ | Loading/error/empty states. |
| 9 | Child profile screen | ✅ | Avatar, age, room, shift progress bar, module cards. |

---

## Phase 2 — Core Daily Loop

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 10 | Daily notes & observations | ✅ | Full CRUD + voice-to-text. AppStrings + updated_by + audit trail all wired. |
| 11 | Documentation completion status bar | ✅ | ShiftProgressBar + CompletionDot. Daily Notes, Bath Temp, Medication all wired live. Cleaning removed from bar at client request. |

| 13 | Cleaning checklists (room + communal) | 🔧 | Built and working but removed from child profile at client request. Code + DB intact. Accessible via `/checklists/cleaning` route. Home-level screen (`HomeCleaningScreen`) built. Revisit placement with client. |
| 14 | Bath temperature check | ✅ | `features/checklists/`. BathTempRecord (freezed), Drift table, DAO, repo (audit wired), provider, screen with bottom-sheet entry. Colour-coded: <37°C blue, 37–40°C green, >40°C red. Wired to completion bar (per-day). schemaVersion 4. |
| 15 | Visitor log | ✅ | `features/checklists/`. VisitorLogEntry (freezed), Drift table, DAO, repo (audit wired), provider, list screen + full entry screen. On-site badge, departure recording, relation chips. Replaces /checklists nav tab placeholder. schemaVersion 5. |

---

| 17 | Medication administration record (MAR) | ✅ | `features/medication/`. PrescribedMed + MedAdministration (freezed). Scheduled vs PRN split. AdminOutcome (administered/refused/held). Outcome-coloured sheet. Completion bar wired (all scheduled meds recorded = done). schemaVersion 7. |
| 18 | Medical history | ✅ | `features/medical_history/`. MedicalProfile + HealthcareContact (freezed). Allergy banner in red (critical). Phone tap-to-copy. 8 contact types. Profile editor + contact bottom sheet. schemaVersion 8. |
| 19 | Behaviour monitoring & charts | ✅ | `features/behaviour/`. BehaviourIncident (freezed), ABC model (Antecedent/Behaviour/Consequence), severity (mild/moderate/severe), physical intervention + injury safety flags with red toggle styling, date/time picker. schemaVersion 9. |
| 20 | Sleep diary | ✅ | `features/sleep_diary/`. SleepEntry (freezed), bed/settled/wake times ('HH:mm'), wakings count, quality (poor/fair/good), per-child list screen + editor. schemaVersion 10. |
| 21 | Food diary | ✅ | `features/food_diary/`. FoodEntry (freezed), 7 meal types colour-coded, appetite (good/fair/poor), description + concerns. Auto-selects meal from time of day. schemaVersion 11. |

| 23 | Smart Steps progress tracking | ✅ | `features/smart_steps/`. SmartStep + StepProgress (freezed), 8 categories, 3 statuses, grouped list (In Progress / Not Started / Achieved), detail screen with progress notes, auto-marks step as Achieved when progress outcome = achieved. schemaVersion 13. |

---

## Phase 4 — Oversight

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 24 | Incident reporting (replaces Datix) | ✅ | `features/incidents/`. IncidentReport (freezed), 6 incident types (behaviour/medical/accident/property damage/missing person/safeguarding), 4 severity levels, immediate action, injury details, police/parent/manager notification toggles, follow-up tracking. Drift table + DAO + repo (audit wired) + providers + list screen + editor. Module card on child profile. schemaVersion 14. |
| 25 | Auto shift handover summary | ✅ | `features/handover/`. HandoverSummaryScreen auto-generates from live Drift data — no manual entry. Per-child cards with flag chips (physical intervention/safeguarding/critical/med refusal) and section rows for notes, behaviour, incidents, medication, bath temp. Accessible via summarize button on Handover tab. |
| 26 | Team Leader oversight queue | ✅ | `features/handover/`. Shift overview screen on the Handover tab. Per-shift progress bar, children split into Needs Attention / Fully Documented sections.

---

## Phase 5 — External Access

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 29 | Regulatory Inspector Access Portal | ✅ | v1 built + audited (session 5). Inspector Portal (`/inspector`) lists active grants, home access screen (children + module sections), generic read-only records viewer for Daily Notes, Care Plans, Incidents, Behaviour, Medication, Medical History, feedback editor (compliment/recommendation/requirement). Manager screen (`/dashboard/inspector-access`) for granting/revoking access and reviewing/resolving feedback. All inspector views + feedback writes logged to `audit_log` via `InspectorAuditService`. `'children'` scope auto-appended on grant creation (required by `inspectors_read_children` RLS). Backend SQL (`supabase_inspector_feedback.sql`, idempotent) run successfully 2026-06-11 — `inspector_feedback` table + RLS, 4 inspector read policies missing from base schema (care_plans, care_plan_goals, medical_profiles, healthcare_contacts), inspector `audit_log` INSERT policy, `user_profiles.email` column + backfill + sync trigger + manager search policy. **✅ Verified end-to-end 2026-06-12 with real manager + inspector accounts**: grant creation (email search), MFA login both roles, portal → home access → module records, feedback submission, manager feedback review, grant revoke, and `inspector_view`/`inspector_feedback` rows confirmed in `audit_log`. Required 3 fixes found during verification (see B3 + Q14 notes). Deferred to a follow-up (same pattern extends cleanly): sleep diary, food diary, activities, smart steps, visitor log, bath temp, cleaning checklists. |
| 30 | Parent/Guardian Portal | ✅ | v1 built 2026-06-12, mirrors inspector portal architecture. `features/parent_portal/`: ParentLink (manual model), cloud-only repos (links + records), riverpod providers, Parent Portal screen (`/parent-portal`, linked children list), child feed screen (`/parent-portal/:linkId` — date-grouped activities with ⭐ reward + 🏆 achievement cards, read-only), manager Parent Access screen (`/dashboard/parent-access` — link parent↔child by email search, per-link photo permission toggle, revoke). Backend: `supabase_parent_portal.sql` (parent_links table + RLS, `parent_has_link()`, parent read policies on children + activity_entries only — no clinical tables, manager parent-search policy; JWT-claim policies per the 42P17 lesson). **✅ SQL run + verified end-to-end 2026-06-12** with a real parent_guardian account: manager link by email search, parent login (no MFA), linked child in portal, activity feed. Found during verification: missing/unknown `app_role` claim fell back to `UserRole.supportWorker` (staff tabs for a parent account) — `UserRole.fromString` fallback hardened to `parentGuardian` (least privilege). Deferred: photo storage RLS for signed URLs (photo gating is per-link `can_view_photos`, avatar only in v1), staff-authored wellbeing updates. |
| 31 | AI-assisted shift summary | ⬜ | Anthropic API via Supabase Edge Function. Auto-summarises shift notes into handover brief. |

## Backend / Supabase

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| B1 | Provision Supabase project — EU region (eu-west-2) | ✅ | Provisioned 2026-05-27. URL: https://uvjvizphpmxybezkjjbl.supabase.co. eu-west-2 London — UK GDPR compliant. |
| B2 | Full schema SQL — all tables with `id, home_id, created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by, deleted_at` | ✅ | 21 tables total (user_profiles, inspector_grants + 19 care tables). Script at `supabase_schema.sql`. |
| B3 | RLS policies on every table, every role | ✅ | All 21 tables have RLS. Auto-RLS enabled on project. home_id-scoped read/write for all roles. **2 backend bugs found + fixed during item 29 verification (2026-06-12):** (1) `managers_read_home_profiles` policy on `user_profiles` subqueried `user_profiles` itself → `42P17 infinite recursion` on every authenticated query (fix: `supabase_fix_user_profiles_recursion.sql`, rewritten to JWT claims; master schema patched too). (2) `authenticated` role had no base table GRANTs on the public schema → `42501 permission denied` regardless of RLS (fix: `supabase_fix_table_grants.sql`, grants + default privileges; RLS remains the row gatekeeper). Both ran against prod 2026-06-12. The backend had likely never served a successful authenticated query before these — sync errors were swallowed by fire-and-forget `_trySyncToSupabase()` (see Q2). |
| B4 | `audit_log` table | ✅ | Audit log table + triggers on all 18 care-record tables. |
| B5 | `inspector_grants` table — `(inspector_user_id, home_id, granted_by, expires_at, scope[])` | ✅ | Table created. `inspector_has_grant()` function + RLS policies ready for Phase 5. |
| B6 | Supabase Auth — MFA (TOTP) enabled for Manager and Inspector roles | ✅ | TOTP enabled platform-wide. Enforcement in Flutter via `needsMfaChallenge` on `AppUser` (reads `aal` JWT claim). |
| B7 | Storage bucket for child photos — EU region, private, access-controlled | ✅ | `child-photos` bucket. Private, 5 MB limit, jpeg/png/webp only. RLS policies in place. |
| B8 | Supabase Edge Function for AI shift summary | ⬜ | Blocked on Phase 5 item 31. Infrastructure ready; function not written yet. |

## Quality & Cross-cutting  *(ongoing — some are overdue)*

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| Q1 | `core/audit/` — AuditLogWriter built and called by all repositories | ✅ | Local Drift part done (I1). Backend `audit_log` table live (B4). **Sync wired 2026-06-12** as part of Q2: AuditLogWriter is a SyncTarget — pending audit rows re-push on every sweep, with 23505 duplicate-key reconciliation (insert-only RLS, no upsert). Dev-mode rows (non-uuid home_id) skipped. |
| Q2 | Proper offline sync queue in `core/offline/` | 🔧 | **Sync engine built 2026-06-12** (`core/offline/sync_service.dart` + `sync_provider.dart`). SyncService sweeps all 15 SyncTargets (14 repos + audit log) on login and every 2 min while signed in: re-pushes every `isSynced = false` row (failed syncs, offline writes — also backfills history from before the 2026-06-12 backend fixes). **Deletes now propagate**: every repo's `delete()` pushes the `deleted_at` tombstone, and upsert payloads carry `deleted_at` (previously deleted records stayed visible in inspector/parent portals forever). Dev-mode rows (non-uuid home_id) skipped to avoid permanent retry spam. Conflict model: last-write-wins upsert. Still open: connectivity-triggered sweeps (timer-only now), per-row backoff, runtime verification on device. |
| Q3 | Date/time — render in Europe/London timezone everywhere | ✅ | Done 2026-06-12. `core/time/uk_time.dart` (`timezone` package, tz db init in main): `UkTime.now()/fromUtc()/todayStr()/startOfTodayUtc()/dayStartUtc()` + `.toUk()` extension. Storage stays UTC. Fixed in one place each: `ShiftType.forTime` (all 14 shift call sites), all `_todayStr()` helpers, today-window queries (visitor log, med admins, bath temp DAO), shift completion, handover/dashboard/behaviour-pattern day bucketing, food editor meal auto-select, editor date defaults, and every display `.toLocal()` → `.toUk()`. Means records filed at 23:30 BST land on the correct UK date/shift even if the device timezone is wrong. Known remaining edge: editor date/time pickers construct device-naive DateTimes on save — only matters if staff record while the device is set to a non-UK timezone. |
| Q4 | Riverpod `select()` — prevent unnecessary rebuilds | ⬜ | Currently using plain `watch()` everywhere. For large screens this will cause rebuild storms. |
| Q5 | Unit tests — all domain models and repositories | ⬜ | 0 tests written. Guide specifies `test/unit/`. |
| Q6 | Widget tests — all screens | ⬜ | 0 tests written. Guide specifies `test/widget/`. |
| Q7 | Integration tests — offline→online sync, auth flow | ⬜ | 0 tests written. Guide specifies `test/integration/`. |
| Q8 | CI — `dart format` + `dart analyze` gate on every push | ⬜ | |
| Q9 | Update ROADMAP.md to reflect actual current status | ⬜ | Needs a full update to match current progress. |
| Q10 | ~~reactive_forms~~ — **dropped from stack** | ✅ | Guide listed it as required but entire codebase (15+ screens) uses TextEditingController consistently. Migrating would be pure churn with regression risk and no functional gain. Removed from pubspec. Decision logged in ROADMAP. |
| Q11 | Fix delete confirmation dialogs — all screens | ✅ | `Navigator.pop(context, ...)` inside dialog builders was using the outer screen context instead of the dialog's own context, causing the wrong navigator to be popped inside ShellRoute. Fixed across all 12 screens (bath temp, daily notes, incidents, behaviour, sleep diary, food diary, activities, smart steps, visitor log, medication, medical history, care plans). |
| Q12 | Fix voice-to-text in daily note editor | ✅ | Original code only acted on `finalResult` which never fired on many Android devices. Removed `localeId: 'en_GB'` (silently failed if language pack missing). Added real-time partial result display. Moved session-end logic to `onStatus` callback in `initialize()` — `await _speech.listen()` returns immediately on start, not on finish, so the previous code was resetting `_isListening` right after starting. |
| Q13 | Full codebase audit — bugs and inconsistencies | ✅ | Found and fixed: `homeId ?? ''` → `'dev-home-001'` in add_child_screen (children would be saved with empty homeId and disappear from all lists); `Theme.of(context)` → `Theme.of(dialogContext)` in 2 remaining dialog builders (care_plan_detail, daily_notes_list); sleep diary FAB `AppColors.roleSupportWorker` → `teal400` (role badge color misused as action color); ABC labels in behaviour_screen hardcoded → AppStrings; mic semanticLabel inline strings → AppStrings. |
| Q14 | Router role-based route guards | ✅ | Added `_isRouteAllowed(location, role)` and `_defaultRoute(role)` to app_router.dart. Redirect now enforces role after auth/MFA checks — forbidden routes silently redirect to the role's default landing screen. Also fixed post-MFA redirect to use `_defaultRoute` (inspector → `/inspector`, parentGuardian → `/parent-portal`) instead of hardcoded `/children`. **Bug found + fixed 2026-06-12:** the role guard ran on `/mfa` (not in any role's allowed list) → redirect loop `/mfa → role home → /mfa` for every MFA role. `/mfa` is now fully resolved by the MFA checks before the role guard runs. |
